# AutoGit

Tired of constantly using git commands when making changes to your code? Just use AutoGit.

* Automatically adds, commits, and pushes.

* Use $1, argument 1, as the message for the commit. (optional)

* Homebrew installation of this feature coming soon.

## Creating an Alias
1. Save 'autogit.sh' in a safe location.
2. Run ```cd ~``` in your terminal
3. Run ```vim .bash_profile``` if you are a mac user or ```vim .bashrc``` if you are using linux.
4. in the .bash_profile or .bashrc file add the line ```alias AutoGit="~/WhereverYouSavedTheFile/autogish"```
5. Run in your terminal ```alias AutoGit="~/WhereverYouSavedTheFile/autogish"```
6. Use AutoGit whenever you need to add, commit, and push.

## Not running?

Run this in your terminal: ```chmod +x autogit.sh```
