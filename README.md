# AutoGit

Tired of constantly using git commands when making changes to your code? Just use AutoGit.

* Automatically adds, commits, and pushes.

* Use $1, argument 1, as the message for the commit. (optional)

* Homebrew installation of this feature coming soon.

## Not running?

Run this in your terminal: ```chmod +x autogit.sh```
